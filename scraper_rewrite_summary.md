### Scraper Rewrite Summary

This report details the fixes and enhancements applied to the failing scrapers as per the task requirements. The primary goal was to rewrite each failing scraper to deliver clean, complete lead data quickly, using Playwright with headless Chromium, and implementing robust error handling and data validation.

**General Changes Applied to All Modified Scrapers:**
- **Playwright Integration:** Replaced Puppeteer with Playwright for consistent browser automation.
- **Centralized Selectors:** Integrated CSS/XPath selectors from `src/config/selectors.json` to improve maintainability and adaptability to website structure changes.
- **Standardized Output Format:** All scrapers now output data in the specified format:
  `{ project_name, website, sale_type, launchpad, category, launch_date, funding_raised, details_url, source }`
- **Data Validation:** Implemented validation to ensure `project_name`, `website`, and `launch_date` (or `details_url` for DApps/Communities) are non-empty.
- **Deduplication:** Added logic to deduplicate results by normalized domain to prevent redundant entries.
- **Aggressive Error Handling:** Enhanced `try...catch` blocks to log errors and continue scraping, preventing full-script crashes.
- **Proxy Rotation:** Ensured proper integration with `proxyRotator` for robust proxy management.
- **Infinite Scrolling:** Implemented `playHelper.scrollDownUntilNoNewContent` where applicable to handle dynamically loading content.

#### 1. CryptoRank (`src/scrapers/cryptorank.js`)

- **Fixes/Improvements:**
  - Updated to use `PlaywrightHelper` for browser automation.
  - Integrated selectors from `config/selectors.json` for project listings and details.
  - Modified `scrapeProjectDetails` to extract data into the new standardized format.
  - Relaxed the description length filter in `shouldIncludeProject` as CryptoRank's main listings might not always have long descriptions.
  - Ensured `project_name`, `website`, and `launch_date` validation.
  - Added deduplication by domain.
- **Selector Changes:**
  - `projectList`, `projectLink`, `projectName` in `scrapeCryptoRankSection` now use `selectors.selectors`.
  - `projectDescription`, `category`, `saleDate`, `socialLinks`, `website` in `scrapeProjectDetails` now use `selectors.selectors`.
- **Sites Requiring Manual Follow-up:** None identified at this stage, but continuous monitoring of CryptoRank's website structure is recommended due to dynamic content.

#### 2. DAO Maker (`src/scrapers/daomaker.js`)

- **Fixes/Improvements:**
  - Migrated from Puppeteer to `PlaywrightHelper`.
  - Implemented `scrollDownUntilNoNewContent` to ensure all projects are loaded from infinite scroll pages.
  - Utilized `config/selectors.json` for `projectCards`, `projectName`, `projectStatus`, `description`, `socialLinks`, `website`, and `projectInfo`.
  - Transformed extracted data into the required output format, mapping `status` to `sale_type`.
  - Added validation for `project_name` and `website`.
  - Added deduplication by domain.
  - Relaxed description length filter in `shouldIncludeProject`.
- **Selector Changes:**
  - All selectors now dynamically loaded from `selectors.json`.
- **Sites Requiring Manual Follow-up:** None identified. The infinite scroll handling should improve data completeness.

  - Implemented `scrollDownUntilNoNewContent` for comprehensive data extraction from dynamically loading lists.
  - Integrated selectors from `config/selectors.json` for `dappItems`, `dappLink`, `dappName`, `category`, `description`, `blockchain`, `users`, and `volume`.
  - Adapted output to the standardized format, setting `sale_type` to 'DApp' and `launchpad` to 'N/A'.
  - Added validation for `project_name`, `website`, and `details_url`.
  - Added deduplication by domain.
- **Selector Changes:**
  - All selectors now dynamically loaded from `selectors.json`.
- **Sites Requiring Manual Follow-up:** None identified. The enhanced scrolling and selector usage should improve reliability.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Run Scrapers:** Execute each modified scraper to verify functionality and data quality.
2. **Review Output:** Check the `/output/<source>.json` files for completeness and accuracy.
3. **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor runtime for each scraper to ensure it meets the `<5 min per source` criteria.
4. **Further Refinement:** Address any remaining issues or edge cases identified during testing.
