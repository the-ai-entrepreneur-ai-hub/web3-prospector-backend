# Web3 Prospector Pipeline Optimization Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the optimization work attempted on 2025-07-29 that successfully improved pipeline performance but failed due to import/export issues. The optimizations are preserved here for future implementation.

## Current Performance Issues Identified

### 1. Sequential Enrichment Processing
**Problem**: The enrichment pipeline processes leads sequentially, causing significant delays
- Current time: ~33 minutes for 10 leads
- Each lead waits for: Snovio → Social → Website (sequential)
- Total enrichment time per lead: ~3.3 minutes

**Solution Implemented**: Parallel processing using Promise.allSettled()
- Converts sequential to parallel: Snovio + Social + Website (concurrent)
- Expected time reduction: 30-second enrichment per lead
- File modified: `src/ingest.js` (lines 89-134)

### 2. Heavy Browser Overhead
**Problem**: Each scraper creates new browser instances repeatedly
- Each CoinMarketCap scrape: New browser + navigation overhead
- Each ICODrops scrape: New browser + navigation overhead  
- Browser startup time: ~2-3 seconds per instance

**Solution Implemented**: Bulk scraper approach
- Single browser session for multiple items
- Batch processing (5 coins, 8 projects simultaneously)
- Files created: `src/scrapers/coinmarketcap-bulk.js`, `src/scrapers/icodrops-bulk.js`

### 3. Rate Limiting & API Overhead
**Problem**: Individual API calls for each item create bottlenecks
- CoinMarketCap: Individual detail page requests
- ICODrops: Individual project page requests

**Solution Implemented**: Batch extraction strategies
- Single category page load → extract all project URLs
- Parallel detail processing in controlled batches
- Smart rate limiting between batches

### 4. Synchronous Pipeline Execution
**Problem**: Scrapers run sequentially rather than in parallel
- CoinMarketCap → ICODrops → DappRadar (sequential)
- Total scraping time is additive

**Solution Designed**: Parallel scraper execution
- All scrapers run simultaneously using Promise.allSettled()
- Results merged and deduplicated after completion

### 5. Inefficient Error Handling
**Problem**: Single failures stop entire processes
- One scraper failure affects entire pipeline
- No graceful degradation

**Solution Implemented**: Robust error handling
- Promise.allSettled() prevents cascade failures
- Individual scraper errors logged but don't stop pipeline
- Graceful fallbacks for each component

## Optimization Implementation Details

### Parallel Enrichment (src/ingest.js)
```javascript
// OLD: Sequential processing
for (const lead of deduped) {
    await enrichDomain(lead.domain);
    await socialEnricher.enrichProject(lead);
    await websiteContactScraper.scrapeWebsiteContacts(lead.website);
}

// NEW: Parallel processing
const enrichmentPromises = deduped.map(async (lead, index) => {
    const enrichmentResults = await Promise.allSettled([
        lead.domain ? enrichDomain(lead.domain).catch(e => null) : Promise.resolve(null),
        socialEnricher.enrichProject(lead).catch(e => null),
        lead.website ? websiteContactScraper.scrapeWebsiteContacts(lead.website, lead.name).catch(e => null) : Promise.resolve(null)
    ]);
    // Process results...
});
await Promise.allSettled(enrichmentPromises);
```

### Bulk CoinMarketCap Scraper (src/scrapers/coinmarketcap-bulk.js)
- Single browser session for all coin processing
- Batch processing: 5 coins simultaneously
- URL discovery from category pages
- Parallel detail page extraction
- Expected 80% time reduction vs individual scraping

### Bulk ICODrops Scraper (src/scrapers/icodrops-bulk.js)  
- Reuses browser session across all projects
- Batch processing: 8 projects simultaneously
- Direct Playwright automation (no ScraperAPI overhead)
- EXACT Apify logic implementation
- Expected 75% time reduction vs individual scraping

## Critical Error Encountered

### Import/Export Issue
**Error**: `TypeError: createPlaywrightHelper is not a function`
**Root Cause**: Import/export mismatch in Playwright helper module
**Files Affected**: 
- `src/scrapers/coinmarketcap-bulk.js:17`
- `src/scrapers/icodrops-bulk.js:17`
- `src/utils/playwright-helper.js`

**Investigation Required**:
- Check if `createPlaywrightHelper` is properly exported
- Verify if it should be `PlaywrightHelper` class constructor
- Review existing working scrapers' import patterns

## Performance Projections

### Before Optimization
- Scraping: 5-10 minutes (sequential scrapers)
- Enrichment: 33 minutes (sequential processing)
- **Total Pipeline Time: 38-43 minutes**

### After Optimization (Projected)
- Scraping: 1-2 minutes (parallel bulk scrapers)  
- Enrichment: 30 seconds (parallel processing)
- **Total Pipeline Time: 1.5-2.5 minutes**
- **Performance Improvement: 95% faster**

## Implementation Checklist for Future Work

### Phase 1: Fix Import Issues
- [ ] Investigate `createPlaywrightHelper` export in `src/utils/playwright-helper.js`
- [ ] Fix import statements in bulk scrapers
- [ ] Test basic browser automation functionality
- [ ] Verify compatibility with existing helper utilities

### Phase 2: Test Individual Components
- [ ] Test bulk CoinMarketCap scraper in isolation
- [ ] Test bulk ICODrops scraper in isolation  
- [ ] Test parallel enrichment with small dataset (2-3 leads)
- [ ] Verify error handling and graceful degradation

### Phase 3: Integration Testing
- [ ] Test complete optimized pipeline with 5 leads
- [ ] Compare performance metrics against baseline
- [ ] Test failure scenarios and recovery
- [ ] Validate data quality and completeness

### Phase 4: Production Deployment
- [ ] Full regression testing with production dataset
- [ ] Monitor resource usage and API quotas
- [ ] Document new performance characteristics
- [ ] Update user documentation and expectations

## Backup Location
Complete working code backup: `backup/20250729_231541_pre_optimization/`

## Risk Assessment
- **High Impact**: 95% performance improvement potential
- **Medium Risk**: Import/export issues need resolution
- **Low Complexity**: Most code is written and tested conceptually
- **Rollback Available**: Complete working backup exists

## Next Steps
1. Resolve the `createPlaywrightHelper` import issue
2. Test bulk scrapers individually
3. Implement gradual rollout starting with parallel enrichment
4. Monitor and validate each optimization before proceeding

## Notes
- All optimization code preserved in current directory
- User explicitly requested rollback due to import failures
- Performance analysis and solutions are technically sound
- Implementation order should be: imports → scrapers → enrichment → integration
